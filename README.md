# AsphyreX
Cross-platform 2D Rendering Engine for Delphi

AsphyreX originated from [Yuriy Kotsarenko](https://asphyre.net)'s famous projects(Asphyre && Asphyre Sphinx). Actually, it's a simplified version of Asphyre Sphinx 3, and is designed&&implemented to develop video games. To be honest, (by now)AsphyreX is not as good as i wished, mostly because i am not familiar with FireMonkey, and I don't have much time on it(I only use Delphi as a hobby).
