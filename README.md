# AsphyreX
Cross-platform 2D Rendering Engine for Delphi(10.4)

AsphyreX originated from [Yuriy Kotsarenko](https://asphyre.net)'s famous projects, Asphyre && Asphyre Sphinx. Actually, it's just a simplified version of Asphyre Sphinx 3, and is designed&&implemented to develop video games. I wrote it in early 2020, at which time i can only stay at home as the pandemic persists.</br> 
To be honest, (by now)AsphyreX is not as good as i wished, mostly because i don't have much time on it(I only use Delphi as a hobby), and i don't know much about FireMonkey.</br></br> 
Maybe I will do some more work on swap chain and rendering UNICODE text, at the right time.</br>
